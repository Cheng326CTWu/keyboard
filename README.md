# 65% keyboard

## Overview

This project was made with the intention of familiarizing myself with the work flow of KiCad. It was also a way to re-learn concepts for schematic captures and the different considerations when laying out a PCB. This repo contains a 65% keyboard PCB design made by referencing tutorials and modifying with new components.
